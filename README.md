# What is this?

This is the front end site meant for a fictional music library management system, to be paired
with the API in the `music-society` project. This front end is written using Vue.js with Quasar components.
Pinia is being used for state management. The project build tool is Vite.

Please note that, as with `music-society`, this is a WIP and incomplete at this time.
